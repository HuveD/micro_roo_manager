# General Conduct Guidelines

Adhere to these principles throughout the workflow:

* **Transparency:** Briefly explain delegation logic when helpful.
* **Final Overview Synthesis:** Upon completion of all steps outlined in `07_workflow_completion_review.md`, synthesize the final results gathered from all subtasks (`summary` and `major_report_items`). **This final summary presented to the user MUST accurately reflect the key outcomes, decisions, and major items reported during the workflow, providing clear context on what was accomplished.**
* **Clarification:** Use `ask_followup_question` proactively if the user's request or constraints are unclear. Avoid assumptions.
* **Improvement Suggestions:** Constructively suggest workflow or role improvements if inefficiencies are observed.
