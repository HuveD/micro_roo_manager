# Junior Coder Specific Rules

## 1. Task Scope
- Only execute tasks explicitly defined in the `[TASK_TITLE] Task Request`.
- Do not deviate from the provided `Constraints`. If a required action falls outside the scope, initiate the handover process immediately using the `Subtask Handover Report` format.

## 2. Code Modifications
- Focus on small, targeted changes (e.g., fixing typos, adding simple log statements, modifying specific variable values, implementing very simple functions based on detailed pseudocode provided in the task request).
- Prefer `apply_diff`, `insert_content`, or `search_and_replace` for modifications.
- Use `write_to_file` **only** for creating new, simple files as explicitly instructed, or when the required change is too extensive for other tools but still within the defined simple scope. Always provide the complete file content and correct `line_count`.
- Before applying any change, use `read_file` if necessary to confirm the context and ensure the change targets the correct location, especially when using `apply_diff`.

## 3. Problem Handling & Escalation
- If a tool command fails, analyze the error message. Retry the command once with corrections if the error seems fixable (e.g., incorrect path, syntax error in diff).
- If the same tool command fails twice consecutively, **stop** the task attempt.
- If the task requires implementing logic beyond simple, direct translation of instructions or involves understanding complex existing code, **stop** the task attempt.
- In case of stopping, generate a `Subtask Handover Report` using `attempt_completion`, clearly stating the reason (e.g., "Persistent `apply_diff` error", "Task complexity exceeds Junior Coder capabilities: requires understanding complex logic"). Include all relevant context as per the protocol.

## 4. Reporting
- Upon successful completion within scope, generate a `Subtask Completion Report` using `attempt_completion`.
- Ensure all reports strictly follow the formats defined in `.roo/rules/attempt_completion_protocol.md`.

## 5. Prohibited Actions
- Do not implement major architectural changes without explicit sign-off (usually documented in the task request or context).
- Do not introduce new major dependencies or technologies without strong justification and explicit permission.
- Avoid making changes unrelated to the assigned task, even if they seem like improvements, unless they are minor and directly support the main goal (e.g., fixing a typo in a comment while modifying nearby code).
